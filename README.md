# pt-connect
# PIneTime Connect Helper 

# This is a simple script that uses the suspend/resume function to reconnect your PinePhone to your PineTime watch

# If you PineTime will not reconnect after wakeing from suspend this may help

# This was created and tested on a Pinephone 3gb running Mnjaro-Arm with PineTime running InfiniTime 1.7.1. The companion app is Amazfish. It should work with Siglo but in my experince Amazfish works better.
